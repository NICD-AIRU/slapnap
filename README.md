## Description

`slapnap` is a Docker image for to develop cross-validation-based
ensemble predictors of neutralization sensitivity/resistance using HIV
sequences from the [CATNAP database](http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The
image provides an automated tool for reading the data from the online
database, compiling analytic data sets, developing prediction models,
and summarizing results.

-----

## Usage

This GitHub repository contains the source code needed to build the
slapnap docker image. However, the repository is also set up for
continuous integration via Travis-CI, with built images found on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/slapnap/repository/docker/slapnap/slapnap).
See the [Docker
website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for
installation instructions.

From a terminal the image can be downloaded from DockerHub via the
command line.

``` bash
docker pull slapnap/slapnap
```

At run time, the user specifies which NAbs are of interest by setting an
environment variable named `Nab` via the `-e` option of `docker run`.
This variable should be set to a semicolon-separated list of Nabs. A
list of possible Nabs included in the CATNAP database can be found
[here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/neutralization/main.comp).
We will provide a reference to a detailed description of the SLAPNAP
workflow at some point in the future. In the end, an HTML report is
produced summarizing the analysis. This report can be accessed on a
local computer by mounting a local drive to `/home/out/` (the directory
in the Docker container where the report is generated) via the `-v`
option to `docker run`. See the [`docker run` help
page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for more details.

Here is an example for developing a predictor of sensitivity to a
combination of `VRC07-523-LS`, `PGT121`, and `PGDM1400`.

``` bash
docker run -e Nab="VRC07-523-LS;PGT121;PGDM1400" \ 
           -v /path/to/directory:/home/out \ 
           slapnap/slapnap 
```

If the `docker run` command successfully completes, an HTML report will
appear in `/path/to/directory`.
