## Description

`slapnap` is a Docker image for developing cross-validation-based ensemble predictors of neutralization sensitivity/resistance using HIV sequences from the [CATNAP database](http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The image provides an automated tool for reading the data from the online database, compiling analytic data sets, developing prediction models, and summarizing results.

---

## Usage

This GitHub repository contains the source code needed to build the slapnap docker image. The repository is also set up for continuous integration via Travis-CI, with built images found on [DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/slapnap/repository/docker/slapnap/slapnap). See the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for installation instructions.

From a terminal the image can be downloaded from DockerHub via the command line.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker pull slapnap/slapnap
```

At run time, the user specifies which nAbs are of interest by setting an environment variable named `nab` via the `-e` option of `docker run`. This variable should be set to a semicolon-separated list of nAbs. A list of possible Nabs included in the CATNAP database can be found [here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/neutralization/main.comp). Other options that can be specified using `-e` include:

* `outcomes`: a semicolon-separated list of outcomes to include in the analysis (defaults to all possible outcomes, `ic50;ic80;iip;sens1;sens2`)
* `learners`: a semicolon-separated list of machine learning algorithms to include in the ensemble learner (defaults to all possible learners [random forests, boosted trees, lasso], `rf;xgboost;lasso`)
* `nfolds`: the number of folds to use in cross-validation (defaults to 5)
* `importance_grp`: a semicolon-separated list of group-level biological importance measures to consider (options are none `""`, marginal `"marg"`, conditional `"cond"`, and both)
* `importance_ind`: a semicolon-separated list of individual variable-level importance measures to consider (options are none `""`, learner-level `"pred"`, and biological marginal `"marg"` and conditional `"cond"`, or any combination)
* `return`: a semicolon-separated list of the output to save in addition to the report (options are `"report"`, `"learner"` for the ensemble learner, `"data"` for the analysis dataset, `"figures"` for all figures from the report, and `"vimp"` for variable importance objects)

For a complete list of options, see the `Dockerfile`.

We will provide a reference to a detailed description of the SLAPNAP workflow at some point in the future.

In the end, an HTML report is produced summarizing the analysis. This report can be accessed on a local computer by mounting a local drive to `/home/out/` (the directory in the Docker container where the report is generated) via the `-v` option to `docker run`. See the [`docker run` help page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) for more details.

Here is an example for developing a predictor of sensitivity to a combination of `VRC07-523-LS`, `PGT121`, and `PGDM1400`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker run -e nab="VRC07-523-LS;PGT121;PGDM1400" \
           -v /path/to/directory:/home/out \
           slapnap/slapnap
```

If the `docker run` command successfully completes, an HTML report will appear in `/path/to/directory`. Any errors or messages will also appear in a nAb combination-specific `.log` file in `/path/to/directory`.
